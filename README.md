Businesses are always looking for ways to optimize their decisions and increase their sales. Bakeries are no different. After that, we know the correlation between items and the customer's shared interests. Businesses can make decisions based on these findings. For example, this bakery should place freshly baked bread near their pastries because customers who buy pastries are also attracted to bread. In addition to product placement, this bakery should offer free item promotions. For example, if they give away some free specialty toast, it may be an opportunity to sell more coffee.
